Program for automatic generation of extensive attribution, including indirect contributors.

# Why?

Typical program that I make is written in language designed and implemented by other people, using libraries made by other people, often using data collected by others.

The libraries were written by other people, data was collected using other programs.

I want to thank at least small part of involved people.

Obviously, most will be missed anyway. With sufficiently deep indirect contributors I would need to list millions of people, maybe more. But I want to try to attribute at least some of them.

# Status

At this moment program is in an experimental stage. Feedback, help and comments are welcomed.

# How?
