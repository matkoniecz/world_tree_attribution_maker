Program for automatic generation of extensive attribution.

# Why?

Typical program that I make is written in language designed and implemented by other people, using libraries made by other people, often using data collected by others.

This programs in turn use other libraries, tools and datasets.

I want to thank at least small part of involved people.

Obviously, most will be missed anyway but I want just to try.
